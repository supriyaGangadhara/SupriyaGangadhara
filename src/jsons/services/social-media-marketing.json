    "contents": [
      "Social media is no longer just a place to post updates—it’s where people discover brands, interact with content, and decide who they trust. For many customers, social platforms are the first touchpoint in their buying journey, making social media marketing a critical part of any growth strategy.",
      "A well-planned social media approach helps your business build brand awareness and credibility while creating real conversations with your audience. It allows you to stay visible, share your story, and engage consistently with people who are most likely to become customers. Beyond engagement, social media also plays a key role in driving website traffic, generating leads, and supporting sales through targeted campaigns and remarketing.",
      "When done right, social media marketing becomes a long-term brand asset. It strengthens customer relationships, improves retention, and supports your overall digital presence. Instead of chasing likes or trends, the focus shifts to meaningful engagement and measurable business impact that grows over time."
